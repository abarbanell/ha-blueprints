# HA-Blueprints

This project contains blueprints for [Home assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/blueprint/)

## Description

These scripts are specific to our use cases in green house automation, They shoud allow us to set up a new green house quickly. Thus, we do not want external dependencies which could break and write our own blueprints even if there may be one available on the internet which does the same job, maybe even better, but is out of our control.
